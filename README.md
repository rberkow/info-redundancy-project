Experimenting with different encoding schemes

1. Signal generation: 64-bit vector comprised of 1s and 0s `#classic`
2. Encoding schemes. We will look at the following
 * 2-D parity coding
 * Hamming (7, 4) code
 * Hamming (8, 4) code
 * bit-wise TMR simulation
 * byte-interlaced parity code
3. Error vectors.
4. Decoding
5. Analysis
